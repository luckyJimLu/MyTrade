## 1、如何进场，设置止损与退出

### 1.1 等待强势信号K线，使用合适的保护性止损。

交易者在大多数交易中应使用止损单入场，以提高盈利概率。具体操作时，需等待明确的信号柱出现。

**卖出时**，应等待价格跌破一根收盘价接近低点的阴线，并在其下方卖出；**买入时**，则需等待一根收盘价接近高点的阳线，并在该柱线上方买入，而不是仅仅在首个出现阳线实体的柱线上方入场。这种方法有助于过滤虚假信号，增强交易的可靠性。

将保护性止损设置在反转形态的稍外侧。例如，如果买入信号柱是当前低点，则将止损设在该K线下方。  如果买入信号柱是多根K线反转形态中的第2根、第5根甚至第6根K线，且第一根K线的低点更低，那么止损应设在最低那根K线的下方。

在阴线收盘价位于或接近其最低点的下方5个点位处进场（通常有多个合适的选择）。初始保护性止损设置在反转形态的高点上方，或重要波段高点（LH）上方，无论你选择哪个进场点。

在阳线收盘价位于或接近其最高点（H）的上方进场（通常有多个合适的选择）。初始保护性止损设置在反转形态的低点下方，或重要波段低点（HL）下方，无论你选择哪个进场点。

### 1.2 永远不要超过整个账号的3%，即使高利润交易

交易者通常应避免单笔交易风险超过账户总额的3%。例如，若账户金额为10,000美元，则单笔风险不应超过300美元。

这一原则同样适用于盈利交易。假设交易已获利500美元，但止损位需设置在400美元距离处，此时实际风险仍为400美元。

遇到这种情况，交易者必须通过减少仓位规模或平仓来降低风险。之后，可等待价格回调至合理位置（PBT）时重新入场，并确保新交易的风险仍控制在3%以内。

### 1.3 等待请示信号K线，使用合适的保护性止损

1. 关于交易频率的建议：
   初级交易者应当专注于波段交易，并以波段交易为主。这意味着他们通常每天进行1-3笔交易。当交易者能够持续稳定盈利后，可以增加到每天3-10笔交易，此时也可以适当加入一些短线交易策略。
2. 关于交易模式的分类：
   基于这个理念，我创建了一个专门为波段交易者设计的模式分类系统。每个模式都有4种变体：买入、卖出、买入失败和卖出失败。大约100种基础模式×4种变体=共400个分类单元。当交易者识别出当前市场的走势模式时，可以参考该模式的历史案例来预判后续可能的走势发展。

（注：swing trade指持仓数小时至数日的波段交易；scalp指持仓几分钟至数小时的超短线交易）

## 2、基本：灵活且对任何事开放

### 2.1 波段交易者与短信交易者

| 波段交易者                                                   | 短线交易者                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **成功的波段交易通常至少需要满足：** 可能短暂如单根大实体K线 通常不要求至少2根大K线或10根K线组合 预期盈利幅度通常需突破震荡区间，且至少达到平均K线幅度的3倍 盈利目标至少是短线交易的2倍，且至少是风险的2倍 最好采用突破单（stop order）入场；等待重大反转或强势突破信号出现才入场；成功概率至少40%（避免逆势交易） 这意味着多数交易会在小盈小亏范围内波动。 | **成功的短线交易：** 盈利目标通常至少达到平均K线高度 通常为1-2倍风险回报比；因此需要大于70%的胜率来弥补不利的风险回报比；盈利约为日均波动幅度的5%-10% 通常持续1-5根K线，可能包含1-2根小幅回调K线；可通过放宽止损间距和分批建仓提高胜率；约半数情况采用限价单（limit order）入场；避免在强势趋势中逆势操作；初期走势通常迅猛，但一旦不及预期应立即平仓。 |

### 2.2 所有交易的三项基础结构：楔形、双顶/底、突破

楔形底：第2腿超跌，形成短暂跌破趋势线(假突破)，形成空头陷阱。随后快速反弹至楔形通道。

双底：LL DB, 在跳空向上，第二个低点可以是完美的双底，或高于，低于前一个低点。

多头突破:  连续相对较大的多头柱线，带有小尾巴，收盘价接近其高点，并且高于交易区间和EMA，第2根K线的实体完全位于EMA之上。

楔形顶：第3退超出趋势线，

双顶：LH 双顶，第2退向上，形成买入高潮

空头突破：连续的相对较大的熊市K线，尾部很短，收盘价接近其最低点，并且低于交易区间和EMA（指数移动平均线）。 第二根K线的实体完全低于EMA。

### 2.3 三重底与三重顶：形态变体与不完美性

 完美三重底：三次向下推动，通常导致回调，任何三推模式可以认为是三重底的变体。

头肩型（截断楔形）：如果市场尝试2次或3次朝一个方向运行但失败了，它通常会转向另一个方向。

双重底下方突破(BO)失败（第二个低点可能在第一个低点处、之上或之下）
