this is Al Brooks
thank you for watching the Brooks Trading course
this is the first of four videos on candles
setups and signal bars
I'll begin by talking about trend bars and
trading range bars
every bar on every chart is either a trend bar
or a trading range bar
just like every part of every chart is either a trend
or a trading range
next
I'll move on to talk about signal bars and entry bars
an entry bar is the bar when you placed a trade
the bar before it is the bar that
made you want to place that trade
it's the signal bar it signaled the trade
and finally I'll talk about bad signal bars
sometimes the context is very good for a trade
but the signal bar does not look very good
if the context is good you have to take the trade
look at these bars
there are some black ones and some white ones
the black ones are bare bars
where the bar opened above the close
and the white ones are bull bars where
the bar opened below the close
it closed above the open
so those are bull bars and the black bars are bare bars
some traders prefer to use green for
bull bars and red for bear bars
but there's something else about these bars
some of the bars have bodies that are small
smaller than half of the size of the height of the bar
and other bars have very small tails
for example
here's a tiny tail on the bottom of this bar
and there's no tail on the top of the bar
the bars that
open at one end and close at the other end
where the bodies are at least half the size of the bar
and especially if the bars are relatively big
I call them trend bars
big bodies
and tails that are not particularly prominent
the bodies are at least half the size of the bar
here are examples of trend bars
and the only other kind of bar that I see on a chart
is a trading range bar
a bar in which
the bulls and bears were about equal
they have smaller bodies
bodies that are
typically less than half of the size of the entire bar
sometimes a trading range bar can be a very big bar
as long as the body is relatively small
compared to the height of the entire bar
so trading range bars like this
body is less than half the size of the bar
some trading range bars have relatively
big bodies compared to the size of the bar
but if the bar is small
I still call it a trading range bar
other bars are extremely big
but have very small bodies
I call those training range bars
here are examples of training range bars
you can see I have a Mark on every bar on the chart
so every bar is either mostly a trend bar
in which the market is going from one end to the other
or a trading range bar
in which it goes both ways
and some bars are in between
and you can call them a trend bar
in certain circumstances
you can call them a trading range bar
but in general I prefer to think of bars as either
trend bars or trading range bars
just like I prefer to look at any chart
as either in a trend or in a trading range
if you're not certain whether a bar is a trend bar
or a trading range bar
look to the left
look at the context
a small body
and a strong trend is more of a trend bar
here we have three consecutive
bull bars and they're all small
but the context is good
we have an II pattern we broke out a little bit here
and we're starting to form
higher lows and higher highs
so this is the early stages of a trend
even though these bars are small
I would call them trend bars
close above the middle
close above the middle close above the middle
tails not especially prominent especially on the bottom
no tails or very small tails
the bulls are beginning to get eager to buy
